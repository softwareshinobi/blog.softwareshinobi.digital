## first day

All right Maria today we're going to talk about your first day and what you're going to be doing I'm not really a person that's really big on interviews and questions right I don't believe that questions are rooted in action they are rooted in somebody moving their mouth I am not a believer in moving mouths so your interview will basically be your first day which is that you're just going to work we're going to just start working immediately you're going to get paid don't worry but if you don't suck then you will will keep doing stuff and you'll you'll keep doing stuff and we'll keep meeting you will keep getting paid and we just keep doing that until we don't all right so that's my interview process

## what we are doing first

All right so one of the first things that I'm going to do is I'm going to teach you to facilitate a meeting using the agile scrum project management style.

so what that means is you're going to learn how to be a project manager first don't worry I am going to teach you I'm going to train you we're going to learn both the traditional agile way and then we're going to use a modified version that I have for my experience so if you're interested that you're going to learn a lot of s*** that comes from corporate so we'll talk about me a little bit later but right now we're really going to focus on like what we're going to hit the ground with

## after the project management

All right so we're going to have the project management training session and the way that session is going to go is I'm going to find some slides off the internet I'm going to give them to you and then you're going to read them and then we're going to movie immediately into you using what you just read to start a meeting and we're going to start running through projects and you're going to leave the meeting you're going to ask questions you're going to give your own answers as well and we're going to be in the project management tool and it's going to be you controlling some stuff okay don't be scared I'm going to teach you this is day one all right

## after standup meeting

All right so after we've gotten done with the project management part the project management part was going to guide what we were going to do together and what I was going to do separate and what you were going to do separate if we end up doing that right so now it's time to get down to work it's time to do action move elbows and stuff like that so I think that one of the first things I want us to do is to talk about content repurposing and I'll talk about that in just a second but we're going to start putting together content pretty much immediately so we're going to use this time to talk about my content strategy talk about your role in the content strategy and what the content strategy is designed to do for for everybody involved

All right so after we've kind of going over content we will of course finish with creating content so we're going to aim to release articles same day I'm going to show you how I do it I'm going to show you you're going to do it we're going to do a couple together and then you're going to have a couple more to do you're going to be doing it a lot but it's nothing crazy you don't have to do writing you just have to learn the process so we're going to explain it later but you're doing you're not going to have to write content from scratch just go with me right now

## after content

All right so after we've gotten done creating some of the written content we now need to start creating some of the audio content that I need created so I would like to use some time where we're going to have you do voice work nothing fancy nothing complicated we're going to record some commercials we're going to record some podcasts discussions and things like that and it's going to be content between you and me and it could be different things so we're talking about maybe it's a discussion between you and me where I'm explaining something to you and you know we'd have questions that you know we talk about it but like scripted questions and then we can respond with each other but it could be didactic I could be using you as an example for some content that I'm creating that you'll understand more about the courses and the books and the newsletters and all of this and your role it's all be related these things will all come together so there there will be sections of our meetings where I want to record the meeting between you and me and our screens that we're sharing and I want to post that to the internet right you'll you'll be I mean you're going to be evolved in the process cuz you're going to do a lot of this stuff but you and me talking about like work activities or we could be talking about whatever but nothing personal nothing private like industry stuff the idea is to create a lot of content a lot of different ways and put that out there right so we're talking about dialogues turning into podcasts YouTube videos don't let that scare you we're just creating a content by doing our jobs we're just recording it

## stretch goal

All right so I want to talk about a stretch goal that I have and it's one for both you and me and and that will be video editing and audio editing and picture editing so I'm sure you don't know how to do that right now and that's okay but I want a growth area for you me and other people in your position which we'll talk about later to be able to bang out quick pictures which I'll get into later but banner acts so being able to take a temple it update the template create a banner at picture and then uploading that to a website and putting it somewhere right that whole flow is something that I want us to also be doing because anyway I'll get more into it later but that's going to be a thing that will be a big advantage of what we're trying to do and we're going to learn together and it's not going to be you on an island but that's what we're going to be trying to do

## the personal assistant part

All right so on top of these more professional focused activities I have a very real need for activities that are more personal to me and I guess so when I say that what I mean is I'm going to need help with things like travel planning and personal research and things along that nature nothing too crazy but you know for example hey I need all the flights that leave this airport that go to this airport put it in this PowerPoint document or put it in this spreadsheet or hey I need to know which countries have what rules about

So let's talk a little bit about one of the other major activities that I will need a lot of help with and that will be content posting across the internet so I'm going to be creating content you're going to be creating content and we're going to be creating content and obviously then the next step is to publish it to the Internet so we're talking about let's say for example I have I give you a spreadsheet full of tweets you login to Twitter and
